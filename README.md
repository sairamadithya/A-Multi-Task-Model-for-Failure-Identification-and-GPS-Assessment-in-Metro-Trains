This project is about the development of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for the identification of faults and assessment of gps quality in metro trains using sensor data.

Background- Air and oil leak are two of the predominant operational failures occurring in public transport modalities, especially in metro trains, which can result in serious issues and causing a lot of downtime. Predictive maintenance on such machinery can be of great use.


Objective- To develop machine learning and deep learning algorithms for the identification of faults and assessment of gps quality in metro trains using sensor data.


Method- The MetroPT dataset is used for this work. The dataset was labeled based on theconditions mentioned in the source paper. The dataset was processed and analyzed monthwise and finally was undersampled. Several machine learning algorithms were trained on the processed dataset. Also, a multi-task deep learning model was developed for the simultaneous identification of failures and gps quality assessment. LIME technique was used to provide explanations for the model predictions. Finally a dashboard was developed for the same application consisting of the best trained algorithm for decision making along with
trend visualizations and explanations.


Result- The developed multi-task model produced 99.99%, 99.99% and 99.99% accuracies in the training set for the failure type, failure location and GPS quality predictions and 98.89%, 99.12% and 99.24% accuracies in the testing set for failure type, failure location and GPS quality predictions respectively.


Conclusion- On the whole, the developed system can be used for effective and reliable real time data visualization.
